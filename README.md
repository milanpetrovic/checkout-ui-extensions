# Checkout Extensions for B2B Planted Store

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) that includes no app home UI. It contains the basics for building a Shopify app that uses only app extensions.


## Getting started

### Requirements

1. [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
1. [login to a Planted Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/3615319).

### Installing and running the app

Install NPM dependencies by running the command from the root of the app.:

```shell
npm install
```

Start the app by running the command from the root of the app.:

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Associate the project with the Shopify App. 

?  Create this project as a new app on Shopify?

```shell
No, connect it to an existing app
```
?  Which existing app is this for?

```shell
âœ”  checkout-extensions-b2b (shopify.app.toml)
```


#### Local Development

Open the URL generated in your console. Once you grant permission to the app, you can start development (such as generating extensions).
